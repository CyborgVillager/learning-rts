v0 Learning RTS: Learning on making rts using python/pygame special thanks to jellyberg
                    Forked Respo: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Aedificus---Fathers_of_Rome
                    OG Respo: https://github.com/jellyberg/Aedificus---Fathers_of_Rome

                    will be decompiling / re-inputing to learn the in's & outs, this will be an massive improvement from
                    Grand-Command https://github.com/CyborgVillager/Grand-Command. Once the decompile is complete will reboot
                    Grand Command into v3

v1 RTS Info: Additional Info from Margaruga for RTS : https://github.com/Margaruga/Games/tree/master/LittleRTSPythonPygame
                    Updated info for v0 in regarding to comments & dissection. Once that is completed will look at LittleRTS for
                    extra info, digging its concept will see what I can do to improve upon these two for Grand Command
                    * Updated Text info for v0

v2 Dissection: New Folder rts_build, modified Rts_game, removed locked buildings. Will probably revert the OG Rts_game for a better
                        reference once the time is needed. For now studying the in's & outs of it

v3 Clone: Testing cloning onto new sys


v4 Screen Resize:    - Enabled Window Screen resize @ my.py @ line 37
          - Made a button for options @ rtsengine.py will soon add the following:
            * Enable user choice for full/windowed screen
--v5 Back to the BASICS: - Will dive further onto using pygamed using coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/ to learn more,
                            new info will be posted @ Games-master/Learning
